  <h1>Axel jump</h1>
  <p>The Axel jump, also called the Axel Paulsen jump for its creator, Norwegian figure skater Axel Paulsen, is an edge jump in the sport of figure skating. It is figure skating's oldest and most difficult jump. It is the only competition jump that begins with a forward takeoff, which makes it the easiest jump to identify. A double or triple Axel is required in both the short programs and free skating programs for junior and senior single skaters in all International Skating Union (ISU) competitions. According to The New York Times, the triple Axel "has become more common for male skaters" to perform, although the quadruple Axel has not yet been successfully completed in competition. As of 2019, 11 women have successfully completed the triple Axel in competition. The Axel has an extra half rotation, which, as figure skating expert Hannah Robbins states, makes a&nbsp;triple Axel "more a quadruple jump than a&nbsp;triple".

<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>The Axel is an edge jump, which means that the skater must spring into the air from bent knees. It is the oldest but most difficult figure skating jump. A "lead-up" to the Axel is the waltz jump, a half-revolution jump and the first jump that skaters learn. The Axel has three phases: the entrance phase (which ends with the takeoff), the flight phase, when the skater rotates into the air, and the landing phase, which begins when the skater's blade hits the ice and ends when they are "safely skating backwards on the full outside edge with one leg behind in the air". According to researcher Anna Mazurkiewicz and her colleagues, the most important parts of the entrance phase is the transition phase (also called the pre-takeoff phase) and the takeoff itself. The jump has a&nbsp;forward takeoff, approached with a&nbsp;series of backward crossovers in either the opposite or the same direction to the jump's rotation, followed by a&nbsp;step forward onto the forward outside takeoff edge.</p>
<p>The skater must also approach the jump typically from the left forward outside edge of the skate, enabling them to step forward. The skater then kicks through with their free leg, helping them to jump into the air. The skater must land on the right back outside edge of the skate. The change in foot required to complete the Axel means that the skater's centre of gravity must be transferred from the left side to the right, while rotating in the air, to reach the correct position to land. As&nbsp;a result, the Axel has an extra half-rotation, which, as figure skating expert Hannah Robbins states, "makes a&nbsp;triple Axel more a&nbsp;quadruple jump than a&nbsp;triple": the single Axel consists of one-and-a-half revolutions, the double Axel consists of two-and-half revolutions, and the triple Axel consists of three-and-a-half revolutions.</p>
<p>Sports reporter Nora Princiotti states, about the triple Axel, "It takes incredible strength and body control for a&nbsp;skater to get enough height and to get into the jump fast enough to complete all the rotations before landing with a strong enough base to absorb the force generated". According to American skater Mirai Nagusu, "falling on the triple Axel is really brutal". It has been shown that the more skilled skaters have greater takeoff velocities and jump lengths. When skaters perform double Axels, they exhibit greater rotations during the flight phase, take off in more closed positions, and attain greater rotational velocities than when performing single Axels. They also increase their turns not by increasing the time in the air, but by increasing their rotational velocity when performing single, double, and triple Axels. According to researcher D.L. King, the key to executing a successful triple Axel is "achieving a high rotational velocity by generating angular momentum at take-off and minimising the moment of inertia about the spin axis". </p>
