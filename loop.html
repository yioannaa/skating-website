  <h1>Loop jump</h1>
  <p>The loop jump is an edge jump in the sport of figure skating. It was created by German figure skater Werner Rittberger, and is often called the <b>Rittberger</b> in Europe. It also gets its name from the shape the blade would leave on the ice if the skater performed the rotation without leaving the ice. It is often performed as the second jump in a&nbsp;combination.</p>

  <h2>Execution</h2>
  <p>The loop jump is an edge jump. The skater executes it by taking off from the back outside edge of the skating foot, turning one rotation in the air, and landing on the back outside edge of the same foot. The jump is usually approached directly from back crossovers, which allows the skater to establish his or her upper body position while gliding backwards on his or her right outside edge before springing into the air. The loop is more difficult than the toe loop and salchow because the free leg is already crossed at takeoff, so the rotation is begun from the edge of the skating foot and the upper body. The coordination and weight shift does not need to be exact while performing the loop, so many skaters consider it an easier jump than the flip and Lutz. It is often performed as the second jump in a&nbsp;combination because it takes off from the same edge as "the standard jump landing".</p>
