<h1>Salchow jump</h1>
<p>The salchow jump is an edge jump in the sport of figure skating. It was named after its inventor, Swedish world champion Ulrich Salchow in 1909. According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, American skater Theresa Weld "received reprimands" at the 1920 Olympics "for performing a&nbsp;single salchow jump because her skirt would fly up to her knees, creating an image deemed too risque".</p>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>According to the ISU, the salchow jump is an edge jump. Its takeoff is made from the back inside edge of one foot and its landing is made on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. The skater enters into the jump with a&nbsp;backward approach, launches it using his or her inside edge, and lands on the opposite outside edge. The free leg is extended behind the skater and swings toward the front as he or she springs into the air while, at the same time, drawing in his or her arms. Skaters do not have to draw in their arms or free leg close to their bodies while performing the single salchow because bringing the free side of their bodies forward and around the opposite side of their bodies after they turn towards the back, is enough to produce the necessary rotation.</p>
