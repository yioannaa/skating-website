  <h1>Toe loop jump</h1>
  <p>The toe loop jump is the simplest jump in the sport of figure skating. It was invented in the 1920s by American professional figure skater Bruce Mapes. The toe loop is accomplished with a&nbsp;forward approach on the inside edge of the blade; the skater then switches to a&nbsp;backward-facing position before his takeoff, which is accomplished from the skater's right back outside edge and left toepick. The jump is exited from the back outside edge of the same foot. It is often added to more difficult jumps during combinations, and is the most common second jump performed in combinations. It is also the most commonly attempted jump.</p>

  <h2>Execution</h2>
  <p>The toe loop is considered the simplest jump because not only do skaters use their toe-picks to execute it, their hips are already facing the direction in which they will rotate. The toe loop is the easier jump to add multiple rotations to because the toe-assisted takeoff adds power to the jump and because a&nbsp;skater can turn his or her body towards the assisting foot at takeoff, which slightly reduces the rotation needed in the air. It is often added to more difficult jumps during combinations, and is the most common second jump performed in combinations. It is also the most commonly attempted jump, as well as "the most commonly cheated on take off jump", or a&nbsp;jump in which the first rotation starts on the ice rather than in the air. Adding a&nbsp;toe loop to combination jumps does not increase the difficulty of skaters' short or free skating programs.</p>
  <p>A skater initiates the toe loop with a forward approach on the inside edge of the blade, then switches to a&nbsp;backward-facing position before its takeoff, which is accomplished from the skater's right back outside edge and left toepick. The jump is exited from the back outside edge of the same foot. The skater approaches the right back outside edge of his or her skate from the landing of a&nbsp;previous jump when done in combination, from the right back outside edge from a&nbsp;right forward inside-to-right back outside three turn, or from a&nbsp;left forward outside-left back inside three turn followed by a change of foot. After completing the three turn, skaters reach the free leg behind them and slightly outside the direction they are traveling, much like a&nbsp;pole-vaulter. Then they place the left toepick in the ice with the opposite foot they will use to make the landing, and jump while pulling the right leg back and around the left and reaching forward and around with the right arm and shoulder, thus achieving the rotation. They draw their arms into the body for the desired number of rotations. They should face forward, with their free leg approximately parallel to their take-off foot and with their arms as close to their body as possible, which results in keeping their arms and legs close to their bodies and remain in tight rotating positions at the moment of take-off, helping them attain faster rotational velocities in the air.</p>
